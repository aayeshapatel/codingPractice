    "Certainly! Here's a list of interval-related problems available on LeetCode, ranging from easy to hard. These problems will help you practice various concepts related to intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Easy Level:**\n",
    "1. **Merge Intervals** \n",
    "   - Problem: Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.\n",
    "   - Example: `Input: [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]`, `Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Insert Interval** \n",
    "   - Problem: Insert a new interval into a set of non-overlapping intervals, merging if necessary.\n",
    "   - Example: `Input: [[1,3],[6,9]], newInterval = [2,5]`, `Output: [[1,5],[6,9]]`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Meeting Rooms** \n",
    "   - Problem: Given an array of meeting time intervals, determine if a person could attend all meetings.\n",
    "   - Example: `Input: [[0,30],[5,10],[15,20]]`, `Output: false`\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Medium Level:**\n",
    "1. **Non-overlapping Intervals**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Problem: Find the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Example: `Input: [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]`, `Output: 1`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Interval List Intersections** \n",
    "\n",
    "   - Problem: Given two lists of closed intervals, find their intersection.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Example: `Input: [[0,2],[5,10],[13,23],[24,25]], B = [[1,5],[8,12],[15,24],[25,26]]`, `Output: [[1,2],[5,5],[8,10],[15,23],[24,24],[25,25]]`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Meeting Rooms II** \n",
    "\n",
    "   - Problem: Find the minimum number of conference rooms required given an array of meeting time intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Example: `Input: [[0,30],[5,10],[15,20]]`, `Output: 2`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Find Right Interval** \n",
    "\n",
    "   - Problem: For every interval in a given array, find the minimum interval that starts after it.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Example: `Input: [[3,4],[2,3],[1,2]]`, `Output: [-1,0,1]`\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Hard Level:**\n",
    "1. **Maximum Number of Events That Can Be Attended** \n",
    "   - Problem: Find the maximum number of events that can be attended given overlapping intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Example: `Input: [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,2]]`, `Output: 4`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons** \n",
    "\n",
    "   - Problem: Find the minimum number of arrows needed to burst all the balloons, represented by intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Example: `Input: [[10,16],[2,8],[1,6],[7,12]]`, `Output: 2`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Car Pooling** \n",
    "\n",
    "   - Problem: Given a list of trips, determine if it’s possible to pick up and drop off all passengers given the vehicle’s capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Example: `Input: trips = [[2,1,5],[3,3,7]], capacity = 4`, `Output: false`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Employee Free Time** \n",
    "\n",
    "   - Problem: Given the schedule of multiple employees, find the time intervals when all employees are free.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Example: `Input: [[[1,2],[5,6]],[[1,3]],[[4,10]]]`, `Output: [[3,4]]`\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Split Array into Consecutive Subsequences** \n",
    "\n",
    "   - Problem: Split an array into multiple consecutive subsequences and return true if possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Example: `Input: [1,2,3,3,4,5]`, `Output: true`\n",
    "\n",
    "These problems will help you master various aspects of interval handling, including merging, sorting, and managing overlaps. Start with the easier problems to build a solid foundation, and then move on to the more challenging ones as you progress."
