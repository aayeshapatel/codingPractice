    "# Binary Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "A Complete Binary Tree is a **type of binary tree**  in which every level, except possibly the last, is **completely filled**, and all nodes are as far left as possible. Forming a complete binary tree involves inserting elements in a specific order.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps to Form a Complete Binary Tree\n",
    "##### 1.Start from the Root:\n",
    "\n",
    "The first element you insert becomes the root of the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. Fill Level by Level:\n",
    "\n",
    "Insert elements level by level from left to right.\n",
    "Start filling each level only after the previous level is completely filled.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3. Add Nodes to the Left First:\n",
    "\n",
    "For each level, add nodes starting from the leftmost position\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example: Building a Complete Binary Tree from an Array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: Start with the Root\n",

    "\n",
    "   1\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: Fill the Second Level\n",
    "\n",
    "Add the next two elements (2 and 3) to the left and right of the root, respectively.\n",

    "Tree:\n",

    "   1\n",
    "  / \\\n",
    " 2   3\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: Fill the Third Level\n",
    "\n",
    "Continue filling from left to right.\n",
    "Add 4 as the left child of 2, 5 as the right child of 2.\n",
    "Add 6 as the left child of 3, 7 as the right child of 3.\n",
    "Tree:\n",
    "\n",

    "  2   3\n",
    " / \\ / \\\n",
    "4  5 6  7\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, this is a complete binary tree:\n",
    "\n",
    "Every level except the last is fully filled.\n",
    "The last level is filled from left to right\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "General Approach for Building a Complete Binary Tree:\n",
    "Insert Elements Sequentially: Start from the root and move level by level, left to right.\n",
    "\n",
    "Representation Using Arrays:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parent**: For a node at index i, its parent is at index (i-1) // 2.\n",

    "**Left Child**: For a node at index i, its left child is at index 2*i + 1.\n",

    "developers often use lists (or arrays) to represent binary trees, particularly complete binary trees or binary heaps. This approach is efficient and straightforward for certain types of trees, such as heaps, where the tree structure is implicitly defined by the indices of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Use Lists to Represent Trees?\n",
    "##### 1. Efficient Memory Usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a list avoids the need for explicit pointers (or references) to child nodes, which can save memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. Direct Access to Nodes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the position of a node's children and parent is **directly calculated using simple arithmetic** on the node's index, accessing nodes is fast (O(1) time complexity for access).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3. Simple Implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementing tree operations like insertion, deletion, and heapify is simpler because the structure is managed through index calculations rather than explicit node connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "How Lists Represent a Complete Binary Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a list where:\n",
    "\n",
    "The root is at index 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "For any node at index i:\n",
    "\n",
    "The **left child** is at index **2*i + 1**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **right child** is at index **2*i + 2**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **parent** of the node is at index **(i-1) // 2**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Common Use Cases\n",
    "##### 1. Binary Heaps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Heaps are typically implemented using lists because they are complete binary trees.\n",
    "Operations like insert, delete, and heapify are efficiently implemented with a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. Priority Queues:\n",
    "\n",
    "Priority queues often use a binary heap, which is represented as a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3. Level-order Traversal:\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with trees where you need to traverse or build the tree level by level, a list representation is convenient.\n"
