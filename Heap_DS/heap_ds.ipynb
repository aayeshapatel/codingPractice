    "# Heaps\n",
    "\n",
    "Heaps are a special tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. The heap can be of two types:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.Max-Heap: \n",
    "In a max-heap, for any given node N, the value of N is greater than or equal to the values of its children. This property ensures that **the maximum value is always at the root of the heap.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.Min-Heap:\n",
    " In a min-heap, for any given node N, the value of N is less than or equal to the values of its children. This property ensures that the **minimum value is always at the root of the heap**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Properties of Heaps:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1.Complete Binary Tree:\n",
    "A heap is always a complete binary tree, which means all levels are completely filled except possibly the last level, which is filled from left to right.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. Heap Property:\n",
    "\n",
    "In a Max-Heap, the parent node is always greater than or equal to its child nodes.\n",
    "In a Min-Heap, the parent node is always less than or equal to its child nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Insertion:\n",
    "\n",
    "Add the new element at the end of the tree (complete binary tree property).\n",
    "Perform the \"heapify-up\" operation (also called \"bubble-up\") to maintain the heap property by comparing the added element with its parent and swapping if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Deletion (specifically the root):\n",
    "\n",
    "Replace the root with the last element in the tree.\n",
    "Remove the last element.\n",
    "Perform the \"heapify-down\" operation (also called \"bubble-down\") to maintain the heap property by comparing the new root with its children and swapping if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Peek (Get the max/min element):\n",
    "\n",
    "In a max-heap, the maximum element can be accessed at the root.\n",
    "In a min-heap, the minimum element can be accessed at the root.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Heapify:\n",
    "\n",
    "Convert an arbitrary array of elements into a heap. This can be done by iterating over the array and applying the \"heapify-down\" operation starting from the middle of the array down to the root.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following array: [3, 9, 2, 1, 4, 5]. If we want to build a max-heap:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start by inserting elements to form a complete binary tree:\n",
    "\n",
    "    3\n",
    "   / \\\n",
    "  9   2\n",
    " / \\ / \n",
    "1  4 5\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Apply heapify-down starting from the last non-leaf node:\n",
    "\n",
    "Swap 3 with 9 to satisfy the max-heap property.\n",
    "The tree now looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "    9\n",
    "   / \\\n",
    "  3   2\n",
    " / \\ / \n",

    "# Recursively heapify the parent\n",
    "self.heapify_up(parent_index)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding Recursion\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recursion** is a technique where a function calls itself in order to solve a smaller instance of the same problem. In the context of `heapify_up`, recursion is used to ensure that the heap property is maintained all the way up the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Happens in the Code\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initial Call**:\n",
    "   - When you insert a new element into the heap, it is added at the end of the list. You then call `heapify_up` on that element’s index to ensure that the heap property is maintained.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Compare and Swap**:\n",
    "   - Inside `heapify_up`, the current node is compared with its parent node.\n",
    "   - If the heap property is violated (e.g., in a max-heap, if the current node is greater than its parent), you swap the current node with its parent.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Recursive Call to Move Up**:\n",
    "   - After the swap, the element that was originally at the current node’s index is now at its parent’s index.\n",
    "   - To ensure the heap property is maintained, you need to check if this parent node (which now holds the value that was just moved up) is in the correct position relative to its own parent.\n",
    "   - To do this, `heapify_up` is called again, but this time with the index of the parent node (`parent_index`).\n",
    "   - This process repeats, moving up the tree until the heap property is satisfied, or the current node becomes the root (i.e., there is no parent to compare to).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Example\n",
